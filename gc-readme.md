G1 collection for 32 gb jvm heap

How to read GC logs and understand the GC behavior

Timestamp: 2023-10-01T12:34:56.789+0000: 0.123
GC Type: GC pause (G1 Evacuation Pause) (young)
Pause Time: 0.0012345 secs
Heap Before/After: Heap: 1024.0K(2048.0K)->1024.0K(2048.0K)
Regions: Eden: 1024.0K(1024.0K)->0.0B(1024.0K) Survivors: 0.0B->1024.0K
This log entry shows a young generation GC pause, the time it took, and the heap usage before and after the GC event.  By analyzing these logs, you can understand the behavior of the G1 garbage collector and identify potential performance issues.


```shell
Pause Young (Normal) (G1 evacuation pause) 32699M->32667M(32768M) 18.24ms
```
This log entry indicates a young generation garbage collection (GC) event using the G1 garbage collector. Here is a breakdown of the log entry:  
Pause Young (Normal) (G1 evacuation pause): This indicates a young generation GC pause, specifically an evacuation pause where live objects are moved to new regions.
32699M->32667M(32768M): This shows the heap usage before and after the GC event:
32699M: Heap size before the GC event.
32667M: Heap size after the GC event.
32768M: Total heap size.
18.24ms: The duration of the GC pause.

In addition to the "G1 Evacuation Pause" (young generation GC), the G1 garbage collector has several other types of pauses:  
Initial Mark Pause: This pause marks the initial set of live objects and is part of the concurrent marking cycle.
Remark Pause: This pause occurs near the end of the concurrent marking cycle to remark objects that were missed during the initial mark.
Cleanup Pause: This pause performs cleanup tasks after the concurrent marking cycle, such as reclaiming space from regions that are mostly empty.
Full GC Pause: This pause occurs when the G1 GC cannot free up enough space through its regular pauses and must perform a full garbage collection.
Each of these pauses serves a specific purpose in managing the heap and ensuring efficient memory usage.
