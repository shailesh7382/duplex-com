## Best Practices for Securing REST API Clients
- Use HTTPS: Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and protect it from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.  
- Authentication and Authorization: Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth2, JWT, or API keys, to ensure that only authorized clients can access the API.  
- Input Validation: Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS).  
- Error Handling: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages. Use a proper logging framework to log errors without revealing sensitive data. 
- Timeouts: Configure connection and read timeouts to prevent hanging requests and improve the resilience of the client.  
- Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by controlling the sources of content that can be loaded.  
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Configure CORS policies to restrict which domains can access the API.  
- Security Headers: Use security headers, such as X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and X-XSS-Protection, to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
